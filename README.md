# IGSN Codelist
A repository containing a [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) version of the IGSN codelists for description metadata originally presented as XML enumerations at <https://github.com/IGSN/metadata/tree/master/description/include>.

Multiple versions of the codelists are stored to show the evolution from XML enumerations to a [SKOS vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System#Overview) to an [OWL ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language).

## Purpose
This Semantic Web version of the codelists has been made to enable the use of the codelist terms with Semantic Web data models, such as the [IGSN ontology](https://github.com/geoscienceaustralia/igsn-ont) employed by [Geoscience Australia](http://www.ga.gov.au) (GA) to describe physical samples in the GA [Samples Register](http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/sample/). This codelist and the IGSN ontology act as a bridge between the XML-based [IGSN descriptive metadata](https://github.com/IGSN/metadata/tree/master/description) and general Semantic Web ontologies for samples metadata, such as [SOSA](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/).
